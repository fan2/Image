Create remarkable visuals.  
Reduce wasted time.  
Share important information.  

## Why Snagit Screen Capture?

Visuals help clarify your message and get you hours back in your work day. Snagit is the premium tool for screen capture and screen recording on Windows and Mac. Combining traditional screenshots, videos, and image editing to help you share important information with the people who need it most.

## Features

### Quickly capture images and videos of your screen.

Snagit’s image and video capture is powerful, but not complex. You’re in control of everything you capture, right down to the pixel. All-in-One Capture® grabs your entire desktop, a region, a window, or a scrolling window from any webpage or application—all with a single hotkey or click.

- Scrolling capture

> Quickly capture a full-page screenshot even if it's not showing on the screen. Grab the horizontal, vertical, or entire scrolling area with just a click.

- Panoramic capture

> Capture wide, horizontal scrolls, infinitely scrolling webpages, and everything in between. Capture once, instead of taking individual captures and manually editing them together.

### Get your point across. Mark up your screenshots.

Showing team members is a lot easier than telling them. Snagit has a dynamic editor that lets you turn plain screenshots or screengrabs into clear, concise communication. Comment over screenshots using text boxes. Point out your ideas with arrows and shapes. Or simply highlight key areas. And Snagit's toolbar is completely customizable so all of your favorite tools stay front and center.
